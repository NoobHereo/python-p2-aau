2nd semester mini project for Struktureret System og -Produktdesign, Robotics.
The purpose of this project is to simulate a concept for a robot that can be applied for householding tasks such as maintaining clean stone slabs
in the yard. The robot proposed in this project is designed to do so and has been written in Python 3.10 and simulated in Webots.
The code is a framework for what would be elaborated on had it been the purpose to code a real robot rather than a simulation. This is due to the fact that the custom
attachments such as the laser and/or brush could not be made in Webots within the group's time budget.
